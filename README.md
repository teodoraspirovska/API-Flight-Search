# API-Flight-Search
 The project focuses on finding flight deals by checking flights between a specified origin city and various destinations, and sending notifications for low-price flight deals via SMS.
 # What I have learned
 Through this project, I gained valuable skills in the following areas:

API Integration: I learned how to interact with APIs to retrieve data and perform actions. Specifically, I used the Tequila API to obtain destination codes and search for flights.

Data Management: I developed proficiency in managing and manipulating data. Using the DataManager class, I retrieved destination data and updated it with new information.

Flight Search: I implemented a flight search functionality using the FlightSearch class. It allowed me to check flights between an origin city and multiple destinations within specific time ranges.

Handling API Responses: I learned how to handle API responses and extract relevant information. By parsing JSON responses, I obtained flight details like prices, cities, airports, and dates.

Notification System: I integrated a notification system using the NotificationManager class. It enabled me to send SMS alerts for low-priced flights, leveraging the Twilio API.

Python Modules: I became proficient in utilizing and importing modules such as datetime, timedelta, requests, and os. These modules facilitated tasks like date calculations, API requests, working with flight data, and managing environment variables.

Error Handling: I improved my skills in handling potential errors and exceptions. I implemented error handling mechanisms to address scenarios such as no flights found or missing data.

Environment Variables: I learned to securely store sensitive information like API keys and credentials using environment variables.

Code Organization: I developed expertise in structuring code using classes and separating functionalities into different modules. This approach enhanced code readability, maintainability, and reusability.

Overall, this project provided practical experience in working with APIs, managing data, implementing search functionalities, handling responses, sending notifications via Twilio, and organizing code effectively. These skills are transferable to other projects and have applications in data retrieval, analysis, and communication with external services.
